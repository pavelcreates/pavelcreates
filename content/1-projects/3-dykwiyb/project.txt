Fentanyl and Synthetic Cathinones have become a major issue for health officials as they have led to an increase of deaths within college aged youth. The two adulterants are common in many recreational drugs commonly taken at raves, festivals, nightclubs and concerts. As most governments take a prohibitory approach, there is no proactive measure in place to reduce harm in these communities. As a response, EZ-Kit has come out with a product to provide a cost-effective, convenient and educational means to reduce the health risk of adulterants at these events.

Provided to concertgoers upon entry, event promoters have an opportunity to reduce the harm created by drug adulterants by putting the power in the hands of those who wish to partake. This initiative for harm reduction hopes to achieve two main goals â€“ provide understanding of the dangers of possible adulterants in the drugs they take and create a self-regulating culture within users that dissuades dealers from adulterating drugs with harmful chemicals.

While this project was completed in Spring 2016, continued research performed at events proves further how important these proactive, product solutions are.
