Text: As with most of our internal work, for this project we traded in design time for unlimited access to provided site analytics, marketing materials, brand guidelines and brand collateral. The goal of the project was to update the client’s website to be more approachable to attract both potential hires and customers in it’s design. Delving into their site analytics and researching the ways their website was utilized within their marketing strategy, it was decided that the best solution was to present the product as a highly-visual experience for potential customers, while maintaining ease of access for customer-only content.
