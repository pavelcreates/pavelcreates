Text: With 40 years of experience and a long-standing reputation for supplying quality products to their industry, Sabre Industrial is a small-medium business that deserved much care and attention to bring their website to the modern era. When researching their current means of promotion, it was sorely lacking - making their website their primary means of external marketing and company information. More importantly, this also meant that most of their clients dealt with the company directly.

Without alienating an older audience, and garnering interest to a growing percentage of young people in decision-making positions - it was decided that the best solution was to utilize the history of the company to convey experience. Using the lens of nostalgia-driven design, reminiscent of 60’s and 70’s era advertising/corporate aesthetics, we were able to retain brand equity, create an accessible experience for older audiences, as well as drive visual and informational interest.
